# Image Classification with CNN

This is a simple image classification project using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built in TensorFlow/Keras. The model was trained on the **CIFAR-10** dataset using Google Colab.

## Features:
- Built using CNN layers in Keras
- Trains a model to classify images into 10 object categories (airplane, car, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, truck)
- Includes accuracy/loss graphs and sample predictions
- Evaluation metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

## How to use:
Open the notebook: `cnn_image_classifier.ipynb`  
Run on Google Colab or locally using Jupyter Notebook.

## Dataset:
Built-in: `keras.datasets.cifar10`

## Results:
- **Test Accuracy**: 82.3%  
- **Test Loss**: 0.60  
- **Precision**: 82.53%  
- **Recall**: 82.3%  
- **F1-score**: 82.38%
